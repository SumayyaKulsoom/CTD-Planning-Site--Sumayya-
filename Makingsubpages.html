  <p>At first we planned to make our subpages similar to the wireframe above, but we realised that our subpages are
</p>
    <p> We actaully did quite a bit of research on the &quot;look&quot; of the website. Some of the websited we looked at were Dior, Chanel and Sasa</p>
    <p> We noticed that websites like these give such a look that satisifies the viewvers. it makes them trust it. The colors are used in the
       right manner. If i was a customer of these websites, whether they were famous or not, I would have no problems buying anything I wanted online.</p>

    <img src="Channel.png"; height= "595" width="962" float="left"/>
    <p> we really liked the colors and the overall outlook of this website because this was something we were looking for </p>
<img src="Dior.png"; height="470" width="1030" float="left"/>
    <p> These were some of the websites we looked at to get the idea of a "trustable" website</p>
  <img src="Sasa.png"; height="500" width:="width:""2210" float=left />
  <p> Sasa wasn't a good idea to look at because we weren't looking for something very gawdy or colorful, so we     rather looked at the wbsite in a negative way than positive way. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p> 1. To find images of the products </p>
<p> 2. Add them to Dreamweaver</p>
<p> 3. Find the information of the products such as the price, quantity and the brand names </p>
<p> 4. Add links to the images so that all of the above information is on a different page when the viwers
click on the image</p>

<h1>Success criteria</h1>
<p> 1. Made the template</p>
<p> 2. Found the images of the products </p>
<p> 3. Added the images to Dreamwevaer</p>

<h1>Buttons</h1>
<p> Mr.Chiu taught us how to make animated buttons. By animated, I mean when we put the cursor on the button, it's no longer
  highlighted, and when the cursor is on the button, it's higlighted. </p>
<p><img src="Button1 .png"; height="196" width="314"/></p>
<p>We first drew a box and entred the text for the button we wanted. </p>

<ul id="yui_3_15_0_2_1428548485778_109">

</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We made a template that will be the same for most of the pages excpet the homepage.
  Each subpage will have the categories,
  the search bar,language bar and the menu bar.</p>

<p> We first made a box and labeled it as "home" and then basically copied the first button and made another 2 with different labels.  After that, we customized the look of the buttons and gave the higlight functions and the font. <img src="Button4.png"; height="205" width="817"/></p>
<p>Lastly, we linked the buttons to the right file so that when we click on the button, it takes us to where we want to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1> How our website looks right now: </h1>
<h3>This is the homepage: </h3>
<p>We have our main content of the website as &quot;Our products&quot; &quot;Local Products&quot; ........ </p>
<p>As we click on them, each of the content takes us to different page. </p>
<p><img src="Website0.png" width="771" height="503" alt="1 " /></p>
<p>For example: This page is &quot;Local Products'', this is showing the products that are locally famous and the peole who tend to </p>
<p>like the products more in hong kong. </p>
<p><img src="Website.png" width="805" height="523" alt="2" /></p>
<p>It's a similar case here, Clicking on a link takes us to the place where we would like it to go. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="website3.png" width="825" height="511" alt="3" /><img src="Website4 .png" width="846" height="506" alt="4" />We recently made the template for the pictures that we would like to click and they'll show the information about the products that are present on the page. </p>
