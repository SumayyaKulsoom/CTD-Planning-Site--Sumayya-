<h2> In class. Mr.chiu assigned us to make a website for a client we like. We were put in groups and told
  to pick a website that we would like to create. We chose to make a website on &quot;branded perfumes and cosmetics.&quot;</h2>

<h2> Re-Design MizSpa.com </h2>
<p> MizSpa.com is website owned by a business man who is doing a wholesale business on cosmetics and perfumes. This website
  sells branded skin care products,cosmetics and perfumes online.They have a wholesale business in Lai Chi Kok and
  Tsim Sha Tsui.Our aim is to design a new website and fix the problems that the client is currently facing.</p>

<h2>Who will be the audience for your website?</h2>
  <p>The audience for the website will mainly be Hong Kong females from the age of eighteen to fifty.
     It could be the ones who can afford branded products and can also be for those who
     cannot afford branded products.</p>
  <h2>Look and feel of the website: </h2>
  <p>I have mentioned this quite a few times before as well. We want our website to give the look and feel of a trustworthy website to our audience. We want to make our audince believe that they can trust the website and the products that the company is selling. Some websites on the internet may not be able to give a look that may convince the audince to buy their products or even try looking at the whole website. The homepage is always the first impression to the website, that's we kept the hompepage simple and neat so that the audince want to carry on looking through other pages. </p>
  <p>The &ldquo;look&rdquo; is defined by the following components of your website:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Color palette</li>
    <li>Images</li>
    <li>Layout</li>
    <li>Font choices</li>
    <li>Overall styling</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The &ldquo;feel&rdquo; is determined by these characteristics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The movement and response of dynamic components like dropdown menus, buttons, forms, and galleries</li>
    <li>Sound effects</li>
    <li>The speed by which pages and images load</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Here are some of he bad exaples of websites that i looked at and though they weren't the ones: </p>
  <p>This was something we wanted to avoid. </p>
  <p><img src="Badwebsite.png" width="527" height="510" alt="badwebsite " /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What we were really looking for was something like this: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2> What will be the specific purpose of your website? </h2>
<p>The purpose of the website is to show the products that the company is selling, the contact information,
 the fact that the company has a free gift wrapping service and  it is visually more traditional from
  their current website &quot;MizSpa.com&quot;,yet classy and professional-looking.The current website mainly targets
   people around China and Hong Kong,therefore, we've been requested to make this website to look &quot;local&quot; and &quot;Chinese,&quot; so
   that it mainly attracts the customers in Hong Kong and China. The client also thinks that this might increase
   the sales throughout the year.</p>

<h2> Who is the client? (Whose problem will creating this website solve? Who would be willing to pay for
  this website?) </h2>
<p>The client is Jacky Altaf, the one who owns the business and the Manipreet Chaudry who is handling the
  computer section. I think it will solve the company's problem because they are in need of a website to target
   local customers and have more customers visit their website and buy their products. Mr. Manpreet expalined to
   us that there isn't much traffic to the website and maybe, by creating a seprate website for local people may
    increase the number of sales online.</p>
   <ul>

<h2>What are the objectives for the project? </h2>
  <p> 1. To email the client </p>
    <p> 2. Create flowcharts </p>
    <p> 3. Create a wirefarame for the website </p>
      <p> 4. Make the homepage on dreamveaver </p>
      <p> 5. Have slideshow </p>
      <p> 6. Have a log-in box </p>
      <p> 7. Have 2 languages -English and Chinese </p>
      <p> 8. Give a trust worthy look-Using good colors, classsic look, proffeciency </p>
      </ul>
<ul>
      <h2> Success Criteria </h2>
      <p> 1. Email the client</p>
      <p> 2. Have a slideshow of the famous products on the hompeage&lt; </p>
      <p> 3. Make the hompeage </p>
      <p> 4. Create flowcharts </p>
      <p> 5. create wireframes </p>
</ul>

<h2> Evidence of initial meeting with with the client: </h2>
<p> My group and I met the client at his office in Lai Chi Kok. He explained his main goals and what they want
  us to achieve through the website. We put down the main points and the eesential inofrmation that he told us
  was important to include in the website. Cureently we have been emailing him and keeping track of his satisfaction
and dissatisfaction</p>

<h2>Flowcharts ideas </h2>
<img src= "Screenshot2.png" height="474" width="668"/>
<img src= "Screenshot3.png" height="479" width="610"/>
<img src= "Screenshot4 .png" height="414" width="663"/>


<h2> Chosen FLowcharts </h2>
<img src= "ScreenShot.png" height="518" width="655"/>
<p> We chose to use this flowchart because this fulfills the requirments of the client. It has 4 pages: &quot;The homepaage&quot;,
  &quot;Some products&quot;, &quot;Local Benefits/About us&quot; &quot;locally Popualr products&quot; and a page for &quot;Ferarri products&quot; (sample page of
  a brand page). Each of them contain most of the things that we want to display. Although we can't put in all the products
   (there are too many), we tried our best to put in the most famous products and the ones that they especially want to sell.</p>

<a href="makinghomepages.html"/></a>

<p><a href="Subpages.html">Planning Subpages</a></p>

<h1>Subpages</h1>
<p>Our group will make a template that will be the same for most of the pages excpet the homepage.
  Each subpage will have the categories,
   the search bar,language bar and the menu bar.</p>

   <img src="Untitled-1.png"; height="596" width="865" />

  <p>At first we planned to make our subpages similar to the wireframe above, but we realised that our subpages are
</p>
    <p> We actaully did quite a bit of research on the &quot;look&quot; of the website. Some of the websited we looked at were Dior, Chanel and Sasa</p>
    <p> We noticed that websites like these give such a look that satisifies the viewvers. it makes them trust it. The colors are used in the
       right manner. If i was a customer of these websites, whether they were famous or not, I would have no problems buying anything I wanted online.</p>

    <img src="Channel.png"; height= "595" width="962" float="left"/>
    <p> we really liked the colors and the overall outlook of this website because this was something we were looking for </p>
<img src="Dior.png"; height="470" width="1030" float="left"/>
    <p> These were some of the websites we looked at to get the idea of a "trustable" website</p>
  <img src="Sasa.png"; height="500" width:="width:""2210" float=left />
  <p> Sasa wasn't a good idea to look at because we weren't looking for something very gawdy or colorful, so we     rather looked at the wbsite in a negative way than positive way. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p> 1. To find images of the products </p>
<p> 2. Add them to Dreamweaver</p>
<p> 3. Find the information of the products such as the price, quantity and the brand names </p>
<p> 4. Add links to the images so that all of the above information is on a different page when the viwers
click on the image</p>

<h1>Success criteria</h1>
<p> 1. Made the template</p>
<p> 2. Found the images of the products </p>
<p> 3. Added the images to Dreamwevaer</p>

<h1>Buttons</h1>
<p> Mr.Chiu taught us how to make a animated button. By animated, I mean when we put the cursor on the button, it's no longer
  highlighted, and when the cursor is on the button, it's higlighted. </p>
<p><img src="Button1 .png"; height="196" width="314"/></p>
<p>We first drew a box and entred the text for the button we wanted. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="Button3.png"; height="228" width="969"/>
<p> We first made a box and labeled it as "home" and then basically copied the first button and made another 2 with different labels.  After that, we customized the look of the buttons and gave the higlight functions and the font. <img src="Button4.png"; height="205" width="817"/></p>
<p>Lastly, we linked the buttons to the right file so that when we click on the button, it takes us to where we want to. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1> How our website looks right now: </h1>
<p>This the homepage: </p>
<p>We have our main content of the website as &quot;Our products&quot; &quot;Local Products&quot; ........ </p>
<p>As we click on them, each of the content takes us to different page. </p>
<p><img src="Website0.png" width="771" height="503" alt="1 " /></p>
<p>For example: This page is &quot;Local Products'', this is showing the products that are locally famous and the peole who tend to </p>
<p>like the products more in hong kong. </p>
<p><img src="Website.png" width="805" height="523" alt="2" /></p>
<p>It's a similar case here, Clicking on a link takes us to the place where we would like it to go. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="website3.png" width="825" height="511" alt="3" /><img src="Website4 .png" width="846" height="506" alt="4" />We recently made the template for the pictures that we would like to click and they'll show the information about the products that are present on the page. </p>
