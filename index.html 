<h1> Design MizSpa.com </h1>
<p> MizSpa.com is website owned by a business man. This website sells branded skin care products, cosmetics and perfumes online.They have a wholesale business in Lai Chi Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.Our aim is to design a new website and fix the problems that the client is currently facing.

<h2> Who is the client? (Whose problem will creating this website solve? Who would be willing to pay for this website?) </h2>

<p> We chose to use this flowchart because this fulfills the requirments of the client. It has 4 pages: "The homepaage", "Some products", "Local Benefits/About us" "locally Popualr products" and a page for "Ferarri products" (sample page of a brand page). Each of them contain most of the things that we want to display. Although we can't put in all the products (there are too many), we tried our best to put in the most famous products and the ones that they especially want to sell.</p>
