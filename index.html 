<h1> In class. Mr.chiu assigned us to make a website for a client we like. We were put in groups and told
  to pick a website that we would like to create. We chose to make a website on "branded perfumes and costmetics."</h1>
<title>Perfumes and Cosmetics </title>
<h1> Design MizSpa.com </h1>
<p> MizSpa.com is website owned by a business man who is doing a wholesale business on cosmetics and perfumes. This website
  sells branded skin care products,cosmetics and perfumes online.They have a wholesale business in Lai Chi Kok and
  Tsim Sha Tsui.Our aim is to design a new website and fix the problems that the client is currently facing.

<h2>Who will be the audience for your website?</h2>
  <p>The audience for the website will mainly be Hong Kong females from the age of eighteen to fifty.
     It could be the ones who can afford branded products and can also be for those who
     cannot afford branded products.</p>

  <h2> What will be the specific purpose of your website? </h2>
The purpose of the website is to show the products that the company is selling, the contact information,
 the fact that the company has a free gift wrapping service and  it is visually more traditional from
  their current website "MizSpa.com",yet classy and professional-looking.The current website mainly targets
   people around the world,therefore, we've been requested to make this website to look "local" and "Chinese," so
   that it mainly attracts the customers in Hong Kong and China. The client also thinks that this might increase
   the sales throughout the year.</p>

<h2> Who is the client? (Whose problem will creating this website solve? Who would be willing to pay for
  this website?) </h2>
<p>The client is Jacky Altaf, the one who owns the business and the Manipreet Chaudry who is handling the
  computer section. I think it will solve the company's problem because they are in need of a website to target
   local customers and have more customers visit their website and buy their products. Mr. Manpreet expalined to
   us that there isn't much traffic to the website and maybe, by creating a seprate website for local people may
    increase the number of sales online.</p>

<h2> Evidence of initial meeting with with the client: <h2>
<p1> My group and I met the client at his office in Lai Chi Kok. He explained his main goals and what they want
  us to achieve through the website. We put down the main points and the eesential inofrmation that he told us
  was important to include in the website. Cureently we have been emailing him and keeping track of his satisfaction
and dissatisfaction</p1>

<h2>Flowcharts ideas </h2>

<h2> Chosen FLowcharts <h2>
<img src= "ScreeShot.png" height="600" width="800"/>
<p> We chose to use this flowchart because this fulfills the requirments of the client. It has 4 pages: "The homepaage", "Some products", "Local Benefits/About us" "locally Popualr products" and a page for "Ferarri products" (sample page of a brand page). Each of them contain most of the things that we want to display. Although we can't put in all the products (there are too many), we tried our best to put in the most famous products and the ones that they especially want to sell.</p>
