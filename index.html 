<h1> Design MizSpa.com </h1>
<p> MizSpa.com is website owned by a business man. This website sells branded skin care products, cosmetics and perfumes online.They have a wholesale business in Lai Chi Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui.Our aim is to design a new website and fix the problems that the client is currently facing.
<h2>Who will be the audience for your website?</h2>
  <P>The audience for the website will mainly be Hong Kong females from the age of eighteen to sixty. it could be the ones wh can afford branded produts and can also be for those who cannot affordbranded products</P>
  <h2> What will be the specific purpose of your website? </h2>
The purpose of the website is to show the products that the company is selling, the contact information, the fact that the company has s free gift wrapping service and  it is visually more traditional from their current website "MizSpa.com",yet high class or professional looking.Their current website mainly targets people in Australia,therefore, we've been requested to make this website look local and "Chinese" so that it attracts the customers in Hong Kong and China as well.
<h2> Who is the client? (Whose problem will creating this website solve? Who would be willing to pay for this website?) </h3>
The client is Jacky Altaf, the one who owns the business and the Manipreet Chaudry who is handling the computer section. I think it will solve the company's problem because they are in need of a website to target local customers. Mr. Manpreet expalined to us that there isnt much traffic to the website and maybe by creating a seprate website for local people may increase the number of sales online.
<h2>What are the objectives for the project? <h2>
